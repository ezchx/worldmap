# worldmap

Free Code Camp "Map Across the Globe" project.

The program shows data from 1,000 meteorite strikes over the last 500 years. Circle size corresponds to the meteorite size. I had to move the map data to my server because the original data location would not allow a remote JSON read.

D3 and JavaScript.
